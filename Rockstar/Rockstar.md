1). We do a reverse image search and we quickly find this website with the name of the place

[https://fr.tripadvisor.ca/LocationPhotoDirectLink-g8565837-d4556785-i313680206-Hard_Rock_Cafe-Luqa_Island_of_Malta.html](https://fr.tripadvisor.ca/LocationPhotoDirectLink-g8565837-d4556785-i313680206-Hard_Rock_Cafe-Luqa_Island_of_Malta.html)

  

2). With this information we find the website we were looking for 

[https://cafe.hardrock.com/](https://cafe.hardrock.com/)

  

3). So we've got the location, it's an international café, so we're off to the place we're interested in : https://cafe.hardrock.com/locations.aspx

We select Malta: https://cafe.hardrock.com/malta-airport/

  

4). On the page we have access to the “local menu”, we go to it and realize that it redirects us to a PDF of the menu : [https://cafe.hardrock.com/malta-airport/files/5425/MIA_Eats_&_Drinks_Menu___2024.pdf](https://cafe.hardrock.com/malta-airport/files/5425/MIA_Eats_&_Drinks_Menu___2024.pdf)

  

In the document properties we have a lot of information, one of which is of interest to us.
